== Electrons and holes in semiconductors

An excellent MITOpenCourseware course that bridges microscopic to macroscopic: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-57-nano-to-macro-transport-processes-spring-2012/index.htm.  In particular, the lecture notes starting at lecture 5 discuss the electronic structure of cyrstals.  For phonons, see Lecture 7.
